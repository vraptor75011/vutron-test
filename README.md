**Vutron** is a preconfigured template for developing `Electron` cross-platform desktop apps. It uses `Vue 3` and allows you to build a fast development environment with little effort.

## ⚠️ NOTE: Vutron now uses the Vite compiler!!!

By using the Vite compiler, we achieved our goals of reducing project and bundle size, and improving development environment and build speed.

The old Vutron using the Webpack5 compiler has been split into the repositories below and will end support soon.

You can easily clone a repository with just the npm command. (Recommend)

```

OR, Clone this repo using below command.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/jooy2/vutron <PROJECT_NAME>
```

After cloning the project, run the following command in the terminal:

```shell
# via npm
$ npm i

# via yarn
$ yarn install

# via pnpm
$ pnpm i
```

## Run in development environment

```shell
$ npm run dev
```

## Build

Once the module installation is complete, you can simply build the platform package with the command below.

```shell
# For Windows (.exe, .appx)
$ npm run build:win

# For macOS (.dmg)
$ npm run build:mac

# For Linux (.rpm, .deb, .snap)
$ npm run build:linux
```

The built packages can be found in `dist/release/{version}` location.

### What do I need to do for a multi-platform build?

**macOS** is recommended if you want to build multiple platforms simultaneously on one platform. Because it can be configured with just a few very simple settings.

You can perform multi-platform builds at once with the following command. Alternatively, you can just do it for the OS you want via the individual build commands above.

```shell
$ npm run build
```

`Multipass` configuration may be required for Linux builds. Learn more about `Multipass` through the following link: https://multipass.run
